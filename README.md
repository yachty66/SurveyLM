# SurveyLM

## what 

a SOTA large language model which can be used for simulating surveys. its aims to has similar functionalities like https://roundtable.ai/.

## why

in my knowledge there is currently no open source model which serves this purpose but its highly valuable to predict how real customer would answer + roundtable has shown its popularity oin hackernews + i learn how to fine tune a model on SOTA llms again + i might take over the task of erik dunteman of finetuning a model with beeing primed on banana.
